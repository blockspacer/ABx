! AI Server: Crash when deleting a game. No proper shutdown or something.
~ Find out how components can communicate with each other and the compositor.
I thought about some event system, but that's too heavy. There must be some
template madness I just dont see yet, because everything is known at
compiletime.
! Debug build of game server doesn't work well, e.g. disconnects when mapping.
~ Revisit GameObject::Serialize and GameObject::WriteSpawnData. A lot useless
stuff is sent. Also the object type should be written in WriteSpawnData(),
like the id_.
! Fix pointer stuff for inventory/equipment/item
