! AI Server: Crash when deleting a game. No proper shutdown or something.
! Debug build of game server doesn't work well, e.g. disconnects when mapping.
The client says "Unknown packet code..." Maybe some messages out of order.
~ Revisit GameObject::Serialize and GameObject::WriteSpawnData. A lot useless
stuff is sent. Also the object type should be written in WriteSpawnData(),
like the id_.
