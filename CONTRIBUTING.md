## Windows

On Windows the easiest is to use Visual Studio 2019 (Community). For each project
there is a solution file `.sln` in the respective directory. There is also
a solution file (`absall/absall.sln`) which contains all server projects.

## Linux

As C++ IDE on Linux I prefer QtCreator. There are QtCreator project
files `.creator` in the subdirectories of the projects. You can also setup
QtCreator to build the projects with the makefiles in the `makefiles` directory.
