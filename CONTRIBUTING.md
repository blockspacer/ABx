# Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and
submit pull requests.

If you have questions, you can reach me via Email with the Email address shown in
my profile. You can also join the `#abxgameserver` IRC channel on the Freenode 
network.

## Rules

* The license is MIT and submitted code must not be incompatible with it.
* The code must compile without warnings, or the CI build fails. The CI build also
fails when a test fails.
* You are encouraged to use new C++ features. Partly this project is also a playground
to explore modern C++.
* The code should be readable and it should be obvious what it does.
* Please stick to the coding style.

## Windows

On Windows the easiest is to use Visual Studio 2019 (Community). For each project
there is a solution file (`.sln`) in the respective directory. There is also
a solution file (`absall/absall.sln`) which contains all server projects.

## Linux

As C++ IDE on Linux I prefer QtCreator. There are QtCreator project
files (`.creator`) in the subdirectories of the projects. You can also setup
QtCreator to build the projects with the makefiles in the `makefiles` directory.

You can also open the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root directory with QtCreator.

## If you don't want to code

That's also great, because a game doesn't need only code. In fact coding is the
smallest problem. It also needs people who do:

* 3D Modeling
* Animations
* Story writing
* Creating maps
* Creating skills
* Music
* Sound effects
* Particle effects
* Icons
* Concept art

and a whole lot more.
